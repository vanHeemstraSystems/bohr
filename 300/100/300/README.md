# 300 - Using the terminal

You can use the terminal to create and publish projects on the platform. You can also use the terminal locally or the terminal available within bohr.io.

In this example, we'll create a Next.js project and name it "my-next-app," then click the "npx create-next-app" button and set your preferences. The project will then be initialized automatically.

```
wvanheemstra@bohr.io:/app $ npx create-next-app

```

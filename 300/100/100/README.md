# 100 - Using a template

To use a template, navigate to the [projects page](https://bohr.io/projects), click "Add a New Project," and select the template.

Next, set the desired subdomain, domain, username, and GitHub repository. At this stage, you may need to grant permissions to Bohr if you haven't done so earlier. Now, you can simply use the pre-prepared build and development variables and publish your project! Click **Publish**.

There you go! Your project is already live and ready to be accessed. Now, you can edit your code and take advantage of bohr.ioâ€™s CI/CD along with GitHub Actions for automatic deployments of your changes.
